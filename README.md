# Third party libraries used:

* Flurl HTTP (https://github.com/tmenier/Flurl): rest client library. Wanted a testable rest client (as I didn't want to spend time writing one) that could be used on PCL projects.

* Xamarin.Forms.Extended.InfiniteScrolling (https://github.com/15mgm15/InfiniteListView): used it to show the list view as if it was paginated. When it reaches the end, the app will request the next page of movies.

* Xamarin.Forms.Mocks (https://github.com/jonathanpeppers/Xamarin.Forms.Mocks): allows me to test methods that create new instances of pages.


The UI was based on this guy "Great Places" sample: https://www.kymphillpotts.com/xamarin-forms-layout-challenges/. As I lost some precious time with my setup (and had to borrow a computer), it was faster and I could finish on time.
